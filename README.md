View routes
-home
-reservation form
-reservation views
API Routes
-View tables
-View waitlist
-Create reservation
-Clear Tables

If view routes return HTML
build out HTML files. 

HTML will have: 
-Boilerplate
-CSS library
-jQuery (cdn)
-set placeholders, like hello world or page title

If I have any routes at all,  I need to build:
-express server

Version control and sharing of files.
